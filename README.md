# 16 Quadrilaterals Geoboard Project

This program challenges users to draw 16 possible non-congruent quadrilaterals on a digital 3x3 pegboard, providing feedback and tracking progress as they explore the problem. 

## Installation

Download the file 16_Quadrilaterals_Geoboard_Puzzle_1.0.jar and run the executable jar file. 

## Using the program

This program is intended for use as part of a grade school math lesson, serving as an alternative or supplement to geoboard math manipulatives. The lesson engages students' ability to think geometrically by solving a special math puzzle. 

On a 3x3 grid, there are 94 possible quadrilaterals that you can draw, but if you don't count congruent shapes, there are 16 unique quadrilaterals you can draw. This program challenges the user to find all 16 of these shapes. 

To draw a quadrilateral, first click one of the 9 pegs on the grid. Click three more pegs to connect the dots, then connect back to the first peg. Finally, click the "submit" button to check your shape. 

If your shape is a valid quadrilateral, it will appear on the grid of 16, and the system will note that you found that quadrilateral. The ordering of the quadrilaterals on the grid was chosen arbitrarily, although similar shapes like squares and trapezoids are grouped together. 

Once you have submitted a shape, press the reset button to reset the board and draw a new one. Clicking undo will also let you go back from the last peg you clicked. If you submit a shape that is congruent to one you already found, the system will let you know.

Continue to try and find as many as you can! Can you find all 16?
