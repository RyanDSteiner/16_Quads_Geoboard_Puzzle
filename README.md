# "16 Quadrilaterals" Geoboard Puzzle

This program challenges users to draw all 16 possible non-congruent quadrilaterals on a digital 3x3 pegboard, providing feedback and tracking progress as they explore the problem. 

## Installation

Download the file 16_Quadrilaterals_Geoboard_Puzzle_1.0.jar and run the executable jar file. 

## Using the program

On a 3x3 grid, there are 16 unique quadrilaterals you can draw by connecting the dots on the grid together. This program challenges the user to find all 16 of these shapes. 

To draw a quadrilateral, first click one of the pegs on the grid. Click three more pegs to connect the dots, then connect back to the first peg. Finally, click the "submit" button to check your shape. 

If you click on a peg in an invalid way such as selecting more than four pegs, or if you submit an invalid quadrilateral, a message will display.  

If your shape is a valid quadrilateral, it will appear on the grid of 16 according to its pre-assigned number. The ordering of the quadrilaterals on the grid was chosen arbitrarily, although similar shapes like squares and trapezoids are grouped together.

Once you have submitted a shape, press the reset button to reset the board and draw a new one. Clicking undo will also let you go back from the last peg you clicked. If you submit a shape that is congruent to one you already found, a message will display. 

Continue to try and find as many as you can! Can you find all 16?

## Background

This program was created by me, Ryan Steiner, as a personal project while I am studying Computer Science at ASU. My project goal was to design a program that provides some value or use case in an educational setting. I used to teach middle school math, and this program corresponds with a math puzzle that I used to challenge students to solve.

I first saw this puzzle in an elementary education class, and it doesn't have a special name, so I call it the "16 quadrilaterals" puzzle. The question at the heart of the puzzle is, "How many unique quadrilaterals can you draw on a 3x3 grid?"

The answer is: There are 94 you can draw altogether, but if you don't count congruent shapes, there are 16 unique quadrilaterals you can draw, hence the name of the puzzle. 

As a teacher, I used this puzzle as part of part of a geometry lesson. In the lesson, students used Geoboards to find the different possible shapes, then recorded their answer with pencil and paper, working in groups to collaborate. I really like this activity because it is relevant to many elementary and middle school math concepts. The exercise helps students learn the special quadrilaterals like squares, trapezoids and parallelograms, but it is also a great way for students to better recognize congruency between shapes after transformations like reflection, rotation and translation.

This program simulates the activity on a virtual board and provides feedback to the user as they explore the problem. It could be used alongside Geoboards in a classroom as a way for students to check their answers and get immediate feedback, or it could be used in an online classroom as a virtual version of the activity. 

However, this version of the program is a prototpye and not intended for any commercial or educational use. I may continue to work on this program in the future, but for now it is just a working prototype. You are free to download and try the program yourself though!
